Suggestions before you begin:

1. Use Debian Linux or Debian Linux derived OS (e.g. Ubuntu)

2. Install gcc and make packages if they are not already installed.

3. Install a favorite text editor. (vim, emacs, gedit, kate or other)

4. Install git, the source code management system used by PSAS. Our
source code repository is located at git.psas.pdx.edu.

Building the cross compiler.

0. Make a directory for the crosstool build utility
   mkdir x-utility

1. cd x-utility

2. Download from http://crosstool-ng.org/download/crosstool-ng/
   the file crosstool-ng-1.17.0.tar.bz2. Save it to the x-utility
   directory just created.

3. tar xjf crosstool-ng-1.17.0.tar.bz2

4. cd crosstool-ng-1.17.0

5. ./configure --prefix /opt/crosstool-ng

    This will test your machine configuration and look for missing
    packages. It may take several attempts to install all the
    dependencies. RELAX, this is normal.

6. make
    At this point, the crosstool-ng utility will build.

7. make install

8. update your path, this involves probably editing your ~/.bashrc file:

    Add these two lines:
    # prepend to path for ct-ng utility
    export PATH=/opt/crosstool-ng/bin:$PATH

    Then in a shell:
    > source ~/.bashrc

    There are other methods of maintaining your path, feel free to uss them
